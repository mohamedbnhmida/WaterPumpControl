üíß Water Pump Control System

This project combines a Flutter mobile application and Arduino-based hardware to control a water pump with advanced features, such as automatic operation based on temperature and current, scheduling, authentication, and historical data visualization using charts.

The project uses Firebase for user authentication, real-time monitoring (RTDB), and data storage (Firestore).

üöÄ Features

Flutter Mobile App
	‚Ä¢	Control Water Pump:
	‚Ä¢	Turn the water pump ON/OFF manually.
	‚Ä¢	Automatic control based on temperature and current values.
	‚Ä¢	Schedule Operations:
	‚Ä¢	Schedule water pump operation with specific time intervals.
	‚Ä¢	Live Monitoring:
	‚Ä¢	View real-time temperature and current readings.
	‚Ä¢	Authentication:
	‚Ä¢	Secure login and registration using Firebase Authentication.
	‚Ä¢	History Visualization:
	‚Ä¢	View historical temperature and current data using charts.
	‚Ä¢	Data stored in Firestore for persistence.
	‚Ä¢	User-friendly Interface:
	‚Ä¢	Clean and intuitive UI with smooth navigation.

Arduino Code
	‚Ä¢	Sensor Integration:
	‚Ä¢	Reads temperature and current values using appropriate sensors.
	‚Ä¢	Pump Control:
	‚Ä¢	Controls water pump operation based on conditions sent from the Flutter app.
	‚Ä¢	Wi-Fi Communication:
	‚Ä¢	Sends real-time sensor data and accepts control commands.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Frontend (Flutter):
	‚Ä¢	Flutter SDK for cross-platform mobile app development.
	‚Ä¢	Firebase for:
	‚Ä¢	Authentication (Login/Signup).
	‚Ä¢	Real-Time Database for live sensor updates.
	‚Ä¢	Firestore for historical data storage.

Backend (Arduino):
	‚Ä¢	Arduino IDE for coding.
	‚Ä¢	Sensors for temperature and current measurement.
	‚Ä¢	Relay module for water pump control.

Charts:
	‚Ä¢	Flutter chart libraries for visualizing historical data.

üì± App Screenshots
	1.	Authentication Screen (Login/Signup).
	2.	Control Dashboard:
	‚Ä¢	Live temperature/current values.
	‚Ä¢	Pump ON/OFF toggle.
	3.	Schedule Screen:
	‚Ä¢	Set specific pump operation times.
	4.	History Screen:
	‚Ä¢	Charts showing temperature/current trends.

üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Water Pump (controlled via a relay module).
	‚Ä¢	Arduino Board (e.g., Uno, Mega).
	‚Ä¢	Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DS18B20).
	‚Ä¢	Current Sensor (e.g., ACS712).
	‚Ä¢	Relay Module for pump control.
	‚Ä¢	HC-05 Bluetooth Module (if using Bluetooth).
	‚Ä¢	Wi-Fi Module (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32) for real-time communication.

üíª Setup Instructions

1. Flutter App
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mohamedbnhmida/WaterPumpControl.git
cd WaterPumpControl


	2.	Install Flutter dependencies:

flutter pub get


	3.	Set up Firebase:
	‚Ä¢	Add your Firebase project credentials to the app (google-services.json for Android, GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS).
	‚Ä¢	Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Real-Time Database.
	4.	Run the app:

flutter run

2. Arduino Setup
	1.	Install the Arduino IDE.
	2.	Upload the provided water_pump_control.ino code to your Arduino board.
	3.	Connect the hardware:
	‚Ä¢	Temperature and current sensors to Arduino pins.
	‚Ä¢	Relay module to control the water pump.
	4.	Configure Wi-Fi or Bluetooth settings in the Arduino sketch.

üì° How It Works
	1.	The Flutter app connects to the Arduino board via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
	2.	Real-Time Monitoring:
	‚Ä¢	Arduino sends live temperature and current readings to Firebase RTDB.
	‚Ä¢	The Flutter app fetches and displays this data.
	3.	Control:
	‚Ä¢	Users can manually turn the pump ON/OFF or set it to automatic mode based on conditions.
	4.	Scheduling:
	‚Ä¢	Users can schedule pump operations, and the schedule is stored in Firestore.
	5.	History:
	‚Ä¢	Temperature and current values are logged and visualized as charts in the app.

üé® UI Flow
	1.	Login/Signup Screen (Firebase Authentication).
	2.	Dashboard:
	‚Ä¢	Real-time monitoring and pump control.
	3.	Schedule Screen:
	‚Ä¢	Add, view, or edit pump schedules.
	4.	History Screen:
	‚Ä¢	View historical data with interactive charts.
